nov 10 notes

array sorting you decrease the array by one and always switch the smallest number into [0] then [1] then [2]

private int smallestinteger[ind]
ind++ int ind=0 etc
array.length = startScan (to pass in a different value for which array slot each time)
it changes the subscript number on the first time as it goes through the loop.
Use a min and max integers.
For and If loop.
Swapping: you need to create a temp value and then do the swap like on the midterm.
