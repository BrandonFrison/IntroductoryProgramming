Notes Nov 24
Method of Struct is created automatically
use Var = new TestStruct();  --- constructer (initializes all members automatically)
when used it will fill all empty list spots with 0 instead of no value.
new operator creates an object or instance.
you can say teststruct1 = teststruct2 only if they are from the same structure.
Messagebox.show(structname.year(<-- struct var))
Structures are pass by value not pass by ref.
outside of method do ref in the method arguments and in the one in the other method.
you cannot compare two structures in boolean using if statement
you must test for the content which is the milege and year and make etc and use the && operators.

Array of Structure.

            const int SIZE = 3;
            Automobile[] cars = new Automobile[SIZE];

            cars[0].make = "Ford";
            cars[0].year = 2011;
            cars[0].mileage = 2345.56;

            cars[1].make = "Nissan";
            cars[1].year = 2010;
            cars[1].mileage = 12345.56;

MB.show(arr[i].make);
